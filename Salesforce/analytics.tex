\subsection{Analytics}
Salesforce's Tableau provides advanced analysis for actionable insights by using customer's data, which enables travel agencies to make decisions depending on data for retention.

This analytics system provides dashboards for data visualization for demonstrating customers' preferences and booking patterns, it allows agents to customize interactions. High-value customers are identified by analytics to target loyalty programs, such as providing exclusive travel discount for frequent users. Agencies can identify low-activity customers by analyzing engagement metrics to \textbf{keep customers engagement}. The predictive analytics can dig out potential issues to address concerns proactively \cite{SalesforceTableau2025}. 

The strengths include interactive dashboards for real-time insights to drive decision-making, AI-driven improvement of retention strategies, and interactions with Service Cloud seamlessly. On the other hand, weaknesses include higher training costs and misleading insights by inaccurate data.
